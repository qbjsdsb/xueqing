-- Phase 0B.1-E forward correction: Storage policies must call a granted
-- SECURITY DEFINER wrapper, not the internal teaching-membership helper.
--
-- The internal helper is intentionally not executable by authenticated users.
-- Storage evaluates policies as the requesting role, so calling it directly
-- makes every valid teacher upload fail with permission denied. The wrapper
-- keeps the same assignment check behind an explicit authenticated grant.
